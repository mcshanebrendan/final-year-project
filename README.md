# Final Year Project â€“ Green Count

This project was originally developed under a GitHub Organization and has since been transferred to my personal GitHub account. It consists of two main components:

- ðŸ”— [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/mcshanebrendan/green-count-frontend)
- ðŸ”— [Backend Repository](https://github.com/mcshanebrendan/greencount-backend)

- ## Project Overview

**GreenCount** is a web app that helps users track their carbon emissions across different activities. The frontend is built using Angular 18 and connects to a Flask backend and Supabase database. Users can log daily activities, view charts showing emission levels, track food-related emissions, and get AI-powered tips to reduce their impact.
